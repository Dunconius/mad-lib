# What is this repo?

Attempting to make a Mad-libs style web app. The goal is to have it:
1. generate a list of random words
2. feed those words into a chat bot
3. return a mad-libs style short story based on the keywords
4. feed one of those keywords into the Unsplash API and return an image to help 'illustrate' the short story.
